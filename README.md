# Entropy Vault command line tool
<p>Target use : Securely store and retrieve sensitive strings like passwords for command line use.<p>

<p>Entropy Vaults are cryptographically obscured files intended to store passwords and other sensitive short strings. Every entry is stored as an encrypted entry that contains payload+hash. To retrieve it the program must decrypt every possible entry in the "entropy vault file" to retrieve it.</p>

<p>There is also no index or any method to list or know what entries are present in the file. The idea is that person A could store an entry after person B and be completely unaware that person A has any data in the vault and vise versa.</p>

<blockquote>"Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty."</blockquote>

<h3><b>Command syntax :</b></h3>
<pre>entrovault -> Entropy vault
 by Olivier Van Rompuy

Search Entry  : entrovault [-s] [-c] [-p vault_password] [-v vault_name] [-% rounds] keystring
Append Entry  : entrovault -a [-q] [-p vault_password] [-v vault_name] [-% rounds] keystring
Replace Entry : entrovault -r [-q] [-p vault_password] [-v vault_name] [-% rounds] keystring
Erase Entry   : entrovault -e [-q] [-p vault_password] [-v vault_name] [-% rounds] keystring
List Vaults   : entrovault -l

Options
 -s     Output string in plain text instead of invisible.
 -a     Append entry
 -r		Replace entry. If not found append
 -e		Erase entry
 -p		Vault password
 -q		Password type payload entry
 -v		Vault name
 -%		Encryption rounds
 -l		List vaults
 -c		Execute content as system commands
 </pre>

<h3><b>Explain by example :</b></h3>
<p><b>Store a password in the vault and retrieve it</b><br/>
You are always required to enter a vault password. This password can be unique per entry, but does not have to be.
This is purely up to the user and the use case. When you append a new entry you are required to confirm the password a second time.
<br/>The -q option allows you to enter the payload via a password style input prompt.
</p>
<pre>$ entrovault -q -a MySecretPassword
Enter vault password for MySecretPassword - 1st : 
Enter vault password for MySecretPassword - 2nd : 
Payload 1st : 
Payload 2nd :
</pre>
<p>Retrieve your password</p>
<pre>$ entrovault MySecretPassword
Enter vault password for MySecretPassword :
PASSW0RD
</pre>

<p>Replace entry</p>
<pre>$ entrovault -q -r MySecretPassword
Enter vault password for MySecretPassword :
Payload 1st :
Payload 2nd :
</pre>

<p>Erase entry</p>
<pre>$ entrovault -e MySecretPassword
Enter vault password for MySecretPassword :
Payload 1st :
Payload 2nd :
</pre>

<p>By default stdin is used as the source for the payload/content unless -q is provided</p>
<p>You can use mixed complexities of encryption with the -% parameter you can choose a customer nr of encryption rounds.
Do note that encryption is done in 2 stages, so the current 3 round default actually results in 6 encryption rounds.
You can go up to 255, but beware that as the vault file grows it will require exponentially more cpu power to retrieve entries. 2-8 rounds is quite secure, anything above is for experimentation only.

<h3><b>Build & Install</b></h3>
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/oli4vr/entrovault.git
$ cd entrovault
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
<p>* Make sure ~/bin is in your $PATH</p>
<br />
<h3><b>More example use cases :</b></h3>
<p><b>Interactive authentication script :</b></p>
<pre>some_application -username=myuser -password=$(entrovault MySecretPassword) ...do some stuff</pre>
<p>* The point here is that you only need to remember the vault password</p><br />
<p><b>Use case for -c : Store and execute sensitive commands</b></p>
<pre>$ echo "some_application -username=myuser -password=XYZABC ..." | entrovault -a mycommand
$ entrovault -c mycommand</pre><br />
<p><b>Safely store (expect) login scripts with hard coded passwords</b><br />
Example Login script with nested jump to a third host :</p>
<pre># vi autologin.sh
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/expect &lt;&lt;EOF
set timeout 2
spawn ssh -t -C username@hostname
expect "password : "
send "PASSW0RD1\r"
expect "$ "
send "ssh -t -C username2@hostname2\r"
expect "password : "
send "PASSW0RD2\r"
close stdin
open /dev/tty
interact
EOF</pre>
<p>Store it in a vault and execute it :</p>
<pre>$ entrovault -v sshvault -a ssh/autologin &lt; autologin.sh
$ entrovault -v sshvault -c ssh/autologin</pre>
